### Getting started

Install `epub_decoder` as a dependency.

### Usage

Start by instancing an Epub from an Epub file:

```dart
import 'package:epub_decoder/epub_decoder.dart';

// Creating an EPUB from an asset transformed to bytes
final epubFile = await rootBundle.load('assets/example.epub');
final epub = Epub.fromBytes(epubFile.buffer.asUint8List());
```
